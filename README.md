## Troubleshooting

When your device is not working well, or not supported yet, please submit the issue and upload your device informations.
If that's still not enough, you can enable the debug mode to get the detail log.

#### Get Device Information

After successful launching Homebridge, the device list will be saved inside Homebridge's persist path.
You can get the file path from running log like this:
```
[2022/11/3 18:37:43] [TuyaPlatform] Device list saved at ~/.homebridge/persist/TuyaDeviceList.{uid}.json
```

Please remove the sensitive data such as `ip`, `lon`, `lat`, `local_key`, `uid` before uploading.

#### Enable Debug Mode

For Homebridge Web UI users:
- Go to the `Homebridge Setting` page
- Turn on the `Homebridge Debug Mode -D` switch
- Restart HomeBridge.

For Homebridge Command Line Users:
- Start Homebridge with `-D` flag: `homebridge -D`
